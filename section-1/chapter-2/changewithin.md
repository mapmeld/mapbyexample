Once data is released to OpenStreetMap, it’s free to expand, edit, and delete.
At the same time as OpenStreetMap mappers want data from governments to build a better public map, cities and other agencies are wondering if they could benefit from the data and suggestions obtained through crowdsourcing. At the City of Boston, we were wondering if there was a mutual partnership that could form, where cities share the data that they have, and get information back. The most common use of OpenStreetMap will be simply as a background, but some users are talking about daily updates and tips for the GIS department to keep their own internal data updated.

ChangeWithin is a Python script from MapBox which tracks changes in a small section of OpenStreetMap. It was created for New York City, but we found that it worked well for Boston, too. Each day, you could receive an e-mail with a list of significant edits. Here’s how it works.
