# Getting the Data

The best source for large-scale health and demographic data are local and federal
government sources.

The US Census has a great deal of information on their site about population count,
age, race, and economic status of citizens at several levels. They map the country
in detail by state, county, tract, block group, and block. The patchwork of "blocks"
set up by the Census are similar to what a person would call a block in a city, but
in rural areas a census "block" may be an entire neighborhood or an island or a park
with no residents.

The City of Chicago has released an unusual amount of data. There have been some heated
discussions and sensational stories about how Chicago may be deciding how to measure
and release this data. For example, several highly suspicious deaths were investigated
and not listed as homicides, possibly to report a lower murder rate for the city.
