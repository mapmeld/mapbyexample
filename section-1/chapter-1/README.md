# Health Atlas

In early 2013 I was waiting to hear back on a job.

I went to Chicago and moved into an Airbnb in Bronzeville. Through Code for America,
I had heard about Datamade, a new data consultancy in Chicago.

The project du jour was Chicago Health Atlas, a choropleth map which would ultimately
be Tweeted out by the mayor and shown at the Chicago Architecture Foundation.
The basic idea is to make sense of Chicago's public data. There are tons of statistics
on health and crime for each community area, going back over a decade.

Not every city has this level of free data. In Chicago, it comes from decades of
maneuvering between corrupt politicians and muckraking journalists. The city has
finally been pressured and legally mandated to share data about contracts, lobbyists,
building permits, and crime.

Of course, transparency does not guarantee justice. People need to be watching the
data for unfair deals. They need to check that the data reported by the city matches
what a reasonable person would expect the data to say. When the city sets up convoluted
systems for some of their environmental and lobbyist data, there's an opportunity for
activists to make these datasets more accessible.
