# Flight Map

Let's do another D3 project.

When I'm flying to a distant part of the world, I get
weirded out seeing the curved "shortest path" line over the flat 2D map. How is the
fastest way to Dubai by going north over Iceland? I need to see these flight paths on
a real globe. That's how I started writing Flight Map.
