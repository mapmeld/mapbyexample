When you are traveling on new territory, either new for you or new for the digital
mapping world, you ought to carry a GPS with you. It’s fun to keep a record of where
you were, and not to gesture at a satellite map later and speculate.

On my Android phone, I use Google’s My Tracks app. It works offline without data,
though it’ll complain and take a long time to adjust to new places. Activate airplane
mode on your phone and turn everything off except for the GPS. Start My Tracks and go
for a walk outside with clear skies… give yourself five minutes or so before you start
a trip to be safe. Don’t fiddle with the phone or reboot - just keep it in your pocket
or do something else while you wait to get located. In bad cases, you can expand the
accuracy in Settings to whatever number it takes to find you.

Try it a few times at home to get the hang of it. Turn off Google Docs sync so you
don’t crash the internet when you connect to someone’s WiFi hotspot. Expect GPS lock
to take longer once you get off an airplane, because the phone will have to try to
listen to a whole new group of satellites.

For this exercise, you can use My Tracks for any trip you want to map - a daily
commute, a weekend bike ride, a hike. Remember that GPS works best outside and above
ground! I’ve had only minor issues with having a GPS in my pocket or in a small,
higher-up pocket on my backpack.

Hit the marker button to add a marker. Write some details, especially if you aren’t
standing directly on the spot. For example, I often write notes like “Hotel Red Panda
nearby north” and from a moving bus “Primary School 1 minute ago”. These notes will
appear in the OpenStreetMap editor later and be amazingly helpful.

Once you’re home, save your data “to external storage” in GPX format, and share/e-mail
the files to yourself. Log into your OpenStreetMap account and go to
http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces/mine to upload these traces to the shared GPS point-cloud.
