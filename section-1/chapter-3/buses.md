 During Code for America, we were lucky enough to work with a local bus agency
 and their GPS logs of bus routes.

 After we updated their bus route map to match the routes that the buses were actually
 running, we started talking about a bus timetable. The city had never printed a timetable
 for more than the transit hub and major stops like grocery and department stores.
With hundreds of stops, it didn't make sense for our three-person team to post timetables
everywhere, but we could write one programmatically.
