OpenStreetMap has a huge collection of GPS data, but probably you just want to throw
some of your trips onto the web and animate through it. You want to show how you
sprinted through the forest and halted at the rocks.

While I was working on projects in the Marshall Islands, I collected GPS tracks
but had no place to view them. Google Earth is usually a great tool for this, but
without internet access it failed to do the job.

I started writing a one-page app where I could drop a file into the web browser
and see playback of my GPS tracks. When I was offline, the background tiles
could come in from TileMill (http://localhost:20009).
