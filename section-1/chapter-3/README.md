I remember the first time that I encountered a GPS. My dad borrowed one from someone at
his work. This was shortly before the GPS satellites were unscrambled for civilian use,
so GPS wasn’t so accurate, and you definitely didn’t see it every day. I think we were
climbing Mount Monadnock or a family-friendly trail in New Hampshire’s White Mountains.
The device was about the size of someone’s forearm and looked like a brick. And no, my
brother and I couldn’t touch it.

GPS fundamentally changed as a concept once it was available to civilians. Several times
we plugged a GPS into a laptop on a long roadtrip to get proper directions and distances
and find hotels on a couple of different Windows programs. It was funny to type a place
like MARS into the directions tool and have it find a place somewhere in the United States.
It was also fun to find places that it didn’t know about.

On most smartphones, you get GPS with additional input from nearby cell towers and WiFi

transmitting back, so you can’t just track planes with iPhones. It’s not clear how much
information is sent back to cell towers and WiFi routers. The phone company certainly
can get a rough estimate of your location using their logs, as this German politician found out:
