Interactive mapping in JavaScript and product development

## Reading this Book

This book is about designing interactive maps. It's also about exploring remote
islands and speaking strange languages and hacking new technologies. It can also
about sitting in meetings and explaining how software works. Life is a mixed bag.

Most importantly, this book is about real projects and problem-solving. There are
tutorials out there which will hold your hand crossing the street, and then leave
you standing at the corner, unsure where to go next. This book assumes you know a little
bit about coding, and lets you jump right into the thick of it. The goal is to make
something true and relevant for those of us who want to make things work.

## Mappers and Programmers

Every one of us is a mapper. You go out your front door, follow some remembered
directions, and go to work. Along that route you have landmarks. You notice
when a new restaurant opens, and when the bus should definitely have been here by now.

Every one of us is also a programmer. If you've tried computer programming before,
you probably doubted that you were a programmer at first. But in truth you have
written several algorithms before, for yourself.

Let's start with an example. You are about to start your lawnmower when a humanoid
robot appears and offers to do all of the work for you. You quickly explain what to do:

    "Walk the lawnmower around until all of the grass has been cut."

Right away you can tell it's the robot's first day, because he is wandering all
around your lawn and wasting time retracing his steps.

    "Go back and forth in narrow lines."

The bag becomes full. The gas tank becomes empty. Each time you explain how to
solve this problem and resume working.

By the end of the day, you have written
a whole lawn-mowing program. But **you already had developed this program for
yourself**. Professional programmers are good at translating our human
instructions into computer instructions. They also can create new ideas and
develop them within the computer-instruction world.
